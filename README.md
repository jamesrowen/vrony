A Processing sketch for making animated Voronoi diagram patterns.

Contains a UI for adjusting parameters manually and automating parameter changes over time.

The Voronoi algorithm is supplied by the wonderful [Mesh library](http://leebyron.com/mesh/) by [Lee Byron](https://leebyron.com/).

## to run

1. Install [Processing 3](https://processing.org/download/).
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Move the `/lib/mesh` folder into Processing's libraries folder (on Mac the default for this is `~/Documents/Processing/libraries`).
4. Open any of the `.pde` files in this project in Processing to load the sketch.
